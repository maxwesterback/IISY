IISY is an issue reporting system that uses QR-codes as the medium to
deliver issues to maintenance personnel.

The general idea for the project is to integrate three components to a
working solution. Purpose for it is to create functionality for reporting
an issue by scanning a QR-code with a smartphone camera. Scanning a
QR-code will open a webpage with a button and when it is pressed, it

will send our customer an issue report regarding the entity that the QR-
code refers to. Data is stored from each action and we'll integrate our

database to a maintenance dashboard. The dashboard is used by the
customer to browse issued alerts. It is also possible to integrate a
database directly to customer-maintained application through REST
API.
